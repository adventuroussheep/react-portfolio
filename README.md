# React Portfolio

## Overview

This is my published portfolio code and contains many animations with a focus on front-end frameworks. The goal was to make an immersive website with many small samples of effects that employers/clients may want on their website. The site uses both open source effects that have been modified to fit the sites needs as well as hand crafted animations.
